”One person’s data is another person’s noise.”
– K.C. Cole

Catalog Description
Introduction to data formats, data collection, data manipulation, data visualization, data cleaning, and data analysis. Introduction to probability and information theory, basic database queries, supervised classification, interpretation of results, and ethical considerations.

Description
Data Science, also known as data-driven science, is an emerging field of scientific inquiry which brings together computer science, statistics, mathematics, and information science, and which can be applied to any other field. In this course, we will learn the basics of statistical thinking, analysis, and inference using the Python programming language as a tool in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world data sets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.

Prerequisite
CS 133, Foundations of Data Science.

Textbook
Python for Data Analysis, Wes McKinney, Second Edition, O’Reilly, Print ISBN: 9781491957660, E-Book ISBN: 9781491957639.

Digital copy of the textbook is available through the library, and on-line if you want to buy it.

Academic Honesty
As a Boise State University student, you have agreed to abide by the University’s academic honesty policy. All academic work must meet the standards
described here: https://deanofstudents.boisestate.edu/academic-integrity/ (Links to an external site.).

Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the
academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

Extra Help
Do not hesitate to contact me about any aspect of the course. The preferred way to contact me is during office hours or on the "Chat" section of Canvas. My office hours are posted to the calendar, and will conducted via Zoom. 

Course Objectives
Students who complete the course will have demonstrated the ability to do
the following:

Demonstrate the capabilities of using data science tools.
Apply proper data visualization to a data set.
Apply proper data cleaning to a data set.
Recognize common data formats.
Apply statistics and probability theory to data science tasks.
Demonstrate the ability to interpret results.
Consider ethical implications of data collection and analyses.
Grading
The final grade will be based on homework, labs, one midterm exam and a final exam, and attendance:

Homework & Labs
Homework and labs must be submitted electronically by the due date and time to receive full credit.
You can still submit your assignment within one week of the deadline. However, 20% late submission penalty will be applied. No submission will be accepted after one week past the due date.
All work must be written individually. Students who copy pro grams or sections of programs from each other or from any other source will be considered to be cheating as will students who allow their programs to be copied.
The first time a student is caught cheating, they will receive a zero for the assignment.
For a second offense, the student will receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported to the Dean of Students.
Exams
Exam dates are fixed and posted on the class web site. Unless alternate arrangements are made in advance, only officially excused
absences will be accepted for missing an exam.
Attendance
Ten percent of the class grade is based on attendance, so students are expected to attend all classes. Material presented in class may not be covered in the textbook, or may be presented using different methods.
COVID-19

Student Well-Being

Counseling Services (1529 Belmont Street, Norco Building) at (208) 426-1459 or email healthservices@boisestate.edu.
COVID 19 Syllabus Notice
Many Boise State classes have resumed face-to-face meetings in the midst of a global pandemic and a recent local surge of infections. Our
goal is to have a successful academic year while keeping our students, faculty, and local community healthy and safe. Public health requirements are in place to achieve that goal, the primary mechanism for which includes the mandatory use of facial coverings that protect all of us.
We have taken health precautions on campus so that you can have the option of a face-to-face course. However, there is still inherent risk associated with face-to-face courses during a pandemic because of proximity to others and length of potential exposure to the virus. Therefore, as
members of this learning community, it is imperative that we all engage in behaviors that protect the overall public health.
You have enrolled in a face-to-face course, and this format offers a number of benefits that appeal to many students. In order to preserve your
access to this face-to-face option you are required to sit in the same seat all semester (for purposes of contact tracing) and wear facial coverings
in all face-to-face learning environments. You must keep your mouth and nose covered at all times throughout class – facial coverings cannot
be pulled up or down for any reason. As a health precaution, eating and drinking are NOT permitted in the classroom.
By enrolling in an in-person course, you agree to comply with Boise State’s rules and precautions which include, but are not limited to, facial coverings, frequent hand washing, hand sanitizing, and sitting in the same seat all semester. Failing to comply with these rules and precautions is a violation of Boise State’s Student Code of Conduct and will subject you to university sanctions and discipline.
University policy states that I am not allowed to begin/continue with instruction unless and until everyone present has a facial covering in place.
This course is designed to be accessible to all students. A very small percentage of people cannot wear facial coverings for reasons related
to medical conditions or disabilities. If this is your experience, please contact the Educational Access Center to document your condition so
that we may determine the best accommodation for you. Until an accommodation is in place, you will need to participate remotely. If you
need to read lips or facial expressions to understand what people are saying, please let the Educational Access Center and me know via email.
If you are unwilling to wear a facial covering, you cannot participate in person. If this is the case, please dismiss yourself and either inquire
whether you may participate in the class fully remotely, or contact the Registrar’s Office (208-426-4249) to pursue your learning experience in
a different remote or online section. Should you refuse to cover your mouth and nose and also refuse to leave the classroom, I have been
directed to dismiss the class and you will be reported to and contacted by the Dean of Students Office.
Mutual Guidelines for Safe Learning Environments
While these public health measures are essential to protecting our individual and communal health, they also complicate how we engage in teaching and learning. The following guidelines should ease our comfort and communication with one another:
In the classroom, we must wear a facial covering that covers our mouth and nose at all times. If you or I let our facial coverings slip, we will politely remind one another to secure our masks.
In the event that we need to step closer to examine someone’s work during class, we will refrain from commenting until we are at a safe distance.
Facial coverings muffle voices. I will use the classroom microphone to amplify my voice through my mask. In addition, I will repeat your questions and summarize comments to ensure we all can follow any discussion.
